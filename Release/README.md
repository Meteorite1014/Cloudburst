# Cloudburst exists somewhat!

This is a re-write of the original Cloudburst mod, adding some of its old content back: a new survivor, Custodian, and a few items.

## Custodian
A [new] survivor finally back from the dead, and finally getting a full round of polish to his abilities. Let us know what you think on our discord https://discord.gg/MNDh59sf2N.
  
His gameplay involves manipulating enemies' gravity to his advantage. Use your Grav-Broom and MAID to float enemies up higher and higher, then spike them down for heavy impact damage!
- fully multiplayer compatible
- Item displays and ragdoll
- EmoteAPI

## What's next
- hopefully some housekeeping to get the project workable if other people would like to step in and do stuff
- more wyatt polish, maybe ancient scepter and all that fun stuff

Cloudburst has a whole laundry list of concepts from our <s>idea guys</s> designers that never saw the light of day. Almost fully fleshed-out designs just in need of implementation. If new items, survivors, enemies, and run-changing content is something that appeals to you, consider joining the team on discord and contributing!
